# Photo Fliper

## Project Overview

This Photo gallery-based project is a web-based image viewer that displays a series of images with accompanying links and music references. The project aims to create a visually appealing and functional image interface using HTML and CSS. Users can navigate through images and access additional resources linked to each image.

## Problem Statement

Keeping physical photo albums can be problematic due to issues such as photos being removed, borrowed, or deteriorating over time. This project provides a digital solution to showcase images in a consistent and accessible format.

## Project Scope

- **Create a page structure** for an image user interface using standard HTML elements.
- **Ensure consistent image sizes** and centering for a uniform look and feel.
- **Link images** to external web pages and additional resources.
- **Embed CSS** directly into the HTML for styling.

## Tasks

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Embed CSS within the HTML page.
   - Create a header section with comments for future implementation.
   - Create a footer with placeholder links for social media.
   - Create a main section with a list of images and links.
   - Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements for images.
   - Add required and optional attributes to image tags.
   - Center images horizontally on the page.

2. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Implement image navigation with "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
   - Add functionality to link images to external webpages and music resources.
   - Ensure JavaScript correctly updates images and links based on user interactions.

3. **CSS Styling**:
   - Ensure images have consistent dimensions using CSS.
   - Center images on the page using CSS properties.
   - Style buttons for navigation and external links.

4. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Create a home page linking to separate image pages (Image 2 and Image 3).
   - Implement links to navigate between the home page and image pages.
   - Ensure all links and image attributes are properly set.

### Navigation

- **Home Page**: Links to Image 2 and Image 3 pages.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Comments**: Use JSDoc or similar documentation to describe JavaScript functions.
- **Improved Navigation**: Enhance page transitions and user experience.
- **Additional Features**: Implement more interactive elements or multimedia content.
